# LiDAR Emulator

In this repository I am trying to create a simulation, where an emulated laser scanner enables a bot to see.

### Things I want to implement:

- [x] basic LiDAR (load in a map and the LiDAR "sees" the outlines)
- [ ] cartographer (obstacles, free space and maybe unknown area)
- [ ] navigation
- [ ] maybe localization and slam
